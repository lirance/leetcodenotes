Dynamic Programming:

Dynamic Programming ofen used to solve __Optimal Substructure problems__ and __Overlapping Subproblems__.

That means when the problem related to "try to find a best way to solve the prolem, and each step have influence to next step", usually Dynamic Programming is a good way to solve it. Usually involved recursive.

there are mainly two technich to solve dynamic programming problems:

1. From top to bottom (use memo to record things already compute.)
2. bottom up.(calculate all the things needed in the sub problem)
